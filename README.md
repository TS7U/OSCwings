# OSCwings

OSCwings is an OSC application for vrchat, allowing realistic flight and increased immersion.

What OSCwings does:   
Interacts with the OSCwings prefab through osc to read your arm position.

Uses that information to create jump inputs, and enable a flying object.

Allowing for realistic flapping and flight!
